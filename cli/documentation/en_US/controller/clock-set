Configure the clock for a controller instance.
Within the controller-node configuration sub-mode, the user can
configure set the clock.

When operating in HA mode with multiple controllers, setting the clock
of the controllers to different values will have an effect on database
reconciliation.   Since time stamps are used to determine which of the
shared items are more up-to-date, if the time between controllers is
very skewed, the any database updates applied may or may no be aplied
correctly.   It is better to try to deal with time skew in the multiple
controller enviromenment by using ntpdate.
