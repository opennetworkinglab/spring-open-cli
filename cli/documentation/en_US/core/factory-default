Reset the controller to the factory default configuration.  This will
wipe out all configuration and logs files and restore the controller
to its initial default configuration.

This will require rebooting the controller node.  When the controller
finishes rebooting, you will need to go through the normal "first time
setup" process, including reconfiguring the network interface
configuration.

Note that if you have customized the controller base image through
debug facilities, then some configuration may not be restored through
this command.  If this is the case, it is recommended that you start
with a fresh controller image.
