Upgrade the controller from an uploaded controller image. To perform 
upgrade, you will first need to upload an upgrade image package by 
scping the file using the "images" user. 

	
Upgrade image package is a file with name of format 
"upgrade-YYYY.MM.DD.XXXX.pkg".
Following is an example to prepare upgrade for controller with IP 
address 192.168.67.141:"

	
scp $path/upgrade-2013.02.13.0921.pkg images@192.168.67.141:"

	
After you run the upgrade, the new controller image will be installed
on the second image partition, and will be configured as the default
boot image.  Running the "reload" command will boot the current node	
If you are upgrading a cluster with multiple nodes, begin by upgrading
the slave nodes followed by the master node.  You can find out which
slave is the master by running "show controller-node all".  You should
upgrade each node by running the upgrade, then reloading the
controller node.

	
For example, if you have two nodes in your cluster, node1 (the current
master) and node2 (the current slave), you should:	


  # Upgrade node2 using the "upgrade" command\\
  # Reboot node2 using the "reload" command\\
  # Upgrade node1 using the "upgrade" command\\
  # Reboot node1 using the "reload" command\\


Note that when you reboot the master controller node1 there may be a
brief disruption in your network.	


Please refer to the section on upgrading in the user guide for more
detailed information, including information on how to revert if the
upgrade fails.
