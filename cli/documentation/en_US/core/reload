This command will restart this controller node.  If you are running as
part of a high availability cluster, this will trigger a failover to
the remaining nodes, but you may wish to manually trigger this first
using the "ha failover" command.

Rebooting the controller will allow you to access the boot menu if you
wish to revert to an older version of the controller software
following an upgrade.  If you wish to do this, select the appropriate
image from the boot loader prompt from the controller console to
choose a different image version.
