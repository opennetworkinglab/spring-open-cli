If you've already run an upgrade operation on this controller node,
but want to abort the upgrade before you reboot into the new
partition, run the "upgrade abort" command to configure the controller
to boot by default from the current-active partition and set the
controller status back to "Ready."

This can allow you to restart a failed upgrade process, for example
if a node failure occurs while attempting to upgrade.
