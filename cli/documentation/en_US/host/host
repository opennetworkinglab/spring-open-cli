The host command enters a submode which
allows configuration for the identified device.  The command's
parameters identify a unique device, which may require
the use of the optional address-space and vlan parameters.

The identified device does not
currently need to be known to the controller, providing
for pre-configuraion of hosts.

Various host configuration within the submode includes
host-alias, and host security associations.

If completion is requested for the hosts, the resulting 
entries shown are the collection of currently known hosts,
and the collection of configured hosts.

The mac address identifying the specific host is
case insensitive.

The 'no' variation of the host command will remove all configured
details for the identified device.  If a 'show host' is issued
afterwards, the host will still appear if the controller has any
operational state assocaited with the host.
