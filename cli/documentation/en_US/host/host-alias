The host-alias command allows associating a more identifiable
name with the host identified by entering the host submode.
Host aliases must start with an alphabetic character, and
can continue with alphanumerics, '_', or '-'.  The maximum length of a
host alias is 255 characters.

Once an alias is associated with a host, various show commands
will provide the alias along with, or instead of the mac
address to identify the host.
