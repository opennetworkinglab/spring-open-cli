This 'show host' variant allows the selection of 
particular related host details, for example the
attachment point or the ip address.  

The variant exists to more completely list the
host's associated attributes.  In the more basic
version of the command, these columns may have
abbreviated information (displaying only one
ip address, for example), to provide a more 
concise display.
