The security command within the host submode is used to
bind ip address and attachment points for the hosts
identified by the submode.

What a host is presented to the controller, the attachment
point of the host is also identified.   When the security
command is used to constrain the attachment point, the
controller can use the configured details to choose whether
it will allow the host to join the network.

When an ip address is bound to the host, no other host
may use the indicated ip address.   This is implemented
by snooping arp's and the dhcp protocol.  It is still
possible for the host to send frames with spoofed
src ip address, but the destination will not be able
to reply to these frames.
