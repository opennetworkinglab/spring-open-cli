The connect command directs the CLI to issue REST API requests to the
selected controller.  The CLI uses the controller's REST API to
perform all configuration, retrieve all the data for show commands,
and also to generate the running config.  The CLI is an application
which presents the controller's REST API to the user, and can also
provide some limited aid to an application write trying to use the
REST API, since the requests issued by the CLI can be viewed with the
'debug rest' command (use 'help debug rest' for more details)

When the controller is running as a HA slave, many commands will not
be available.  If the master has configured port 80 to be available
(controller-node interface submode's firewall command), then by using
the connect command to use the master's REST API, ssh can be avoided.
This would preserve the command history, allowing an easy way to
re-issue failed commands.

The REST API for the controller is typically configured at port 80.

Completion for the command will display all the currently known
controllers.  If the connect succeeds, the list of known controllers
will very likely be different.
