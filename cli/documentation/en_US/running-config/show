The 'show running-config' command displays the complete
configuration for the controller.   When the controller
is operating with HA enabled, 'show running-config' displays
the configuraion of the HA cluster.

The running-config is intended to show the configuration
necessary to update a default configuration to the current
configuration.  The running-config then displays deviations
from the default configuration; configuration whice arises
from the default configuration will not be shown in the
running-config

While operating with HA enabled, a replay of the running
config will not cause a slave to be (re)configured into
HA-enabled if it is not already operating as HA-enabled.
