This 'show vns <id>' command variation is used to identify a specific vns or VNSs defined under current tenant mode.
This 'show vns all'  command variation is used to display all VNSs defined across all tenants.
Being backward compatible, 'show vns' command under non config-tenant mode is also accepted and displays the VNSs for default tenant only.
