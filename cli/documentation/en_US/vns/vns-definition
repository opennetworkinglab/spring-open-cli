This submode is used to create, then describe the membership of
devices for the named VNS.   Within this submode, properties of
the VNS can be configured.   Interface-rules are configured and
managed, which configure the membership of devices.

The controller provides a VNS named 'default' to collect devices
which are not associated with any VNS.   

Part of the configuration associated with a VNS includes the
association of a particular address-space.   When not speficially
configured, the 'default' address-space is associated with the
VNS.

Each address-space also has an associated default VNS.  IF the
address space is called 'yellow', then the default VNS for this
address space is called 'yellow-default'
