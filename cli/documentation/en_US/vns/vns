This command is used to enter a submode to manage properties
associated with the virtual switch.  This currently includes
acl managment, and association of the acls rules to interfaces.

The named vns-id must already exist.  See the vns-definition
command to create new VNSs.

Withing this submode, two other submodes can be entered.  The
access-list submode associates specific acl rules with an access list,
while the interface submode allows association of named access rules
to specific interfaces.
