The match command is used to tag hosts. MAC-address, VLAN, switch, switch-port are the fields that can be matched to tag hosts. These fields can be matched individually or in conjunction. For instance, if match is specified to match a MAC-Address, VLAN and switch-port, then the logical host that has that MAC-Address, sending packets tagged with that VLAN and connected to that switch-port is tagged. Whereas, if the match is just on a switch, then all the hosts connected to that switch are tagged. Tag-value can be associated with multiple such match statements, thus tagging hosts that match atleast one of the match statements.

The 'no' variation of the match command will remove the match statement and untag all the hosts that were tagged as a result of match on that match statement.
