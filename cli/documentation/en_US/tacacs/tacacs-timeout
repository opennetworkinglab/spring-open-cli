Configure the global timeout for communicating with TACACS+ servers.
The timeout is specified in seconds.

If the timeout expires before the TACACS+ server responds,
then the TACACS+ aaa action is considered 'failed',
and other methods can be attempted.

The server timeout is reset to the system default using the 'no' 
command prefix.
