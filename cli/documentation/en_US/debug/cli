cli choices for the debug command enables various
different cli features.  First the cli will
provide details about internal failures, which is
intended to provide a detailed description for
some failure.  Failures may occur not only in the
execution of commands, but while building the
command, for example during the generation of
completion choices.  Second, the cli option also
enables direct editing of many of the underlying
models (database tables) exported by the REST API.
This feature is intended to provide a way to view
or modify the internal contents of the database.
